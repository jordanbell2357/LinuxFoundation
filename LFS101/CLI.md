| The command line often allows the users to perform tasks more efficiently than the GUI.                                                                                  |

| awk is an interpreted programming language, typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.                                                                      |

| Regular expressions are text strings used for pattern matching. The pattern can be used to search for a specific location, such as the start or end of a line or a word. |
| grep searches text files and data streams for patterns and can be used with regular expressions.                                                                         |

| tee saves a copy of standard output to a file while still displaying at the terminal.                                                                                    |
| wc (word count) displays the number of lines, words, and characters in a file or group of files.                                                                         |

| less views files a page at a time and allows scrolling in both directions.                                                                                               |
| head displays the first few lines of a file or data stream on standard output. By default, it displays 10 lines.                                                         |
| tail displays the last few lines of a file or data stream on standard output. By default, it displays 10 lines.                                                          |
| strings extracts printable character strings from binary files.                                                                                                          |
| The z command family is used to read and work with compressed files.                                                                                                     |
